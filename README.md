# SolarViz

Website interface to visualize energy consumption

## Project Outline by Melissa

For this project we will be working with the Building Manager of the Hasso Plattner School of Design Thinking Afrika (d-school Afrika) to develop a new dashboard to help visualize electricity usage and generation in the building. The new HPI d-school building is the first 6-star green-rated education building in South Africa, with solar power, automatic lighting and energy-efficient heating and cooling. The power systems have an API - you will build a dashboard based on the specifications and requirements of the building residents, which will be available for viewing on mobile devices and displayed on the main building screen overlooking the atrium. This project requires a user-centred mindset, a bit of design thinking, and willingness to learn new platforms and to work with an existing API.
